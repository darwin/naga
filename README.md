# SpyV8 - Son of PyV8 

SpyV8 is a project for upgrading PyV8 to work with the latest Google V8 build.

This code links with Google V8 built as a static library. Currently the library builds
on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 19.10 and Gentoo) and MacOS Catalina and has
been tested on Python 3.6.9 and 3.7.5.

Please refer to documentation for building and usage instructions.
